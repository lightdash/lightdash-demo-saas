          CloseRate Kevin: This model contains global office location data ideal for bubble map visualizations.
          Use `latitude` and `longitude` for point-based maps, with `annual_revenue_usd` for bubble size and `employee_count` for bubble color (or vice versa).
          Perfect for visualizing office performance across the globe - compare revenue per employee, identify high-performing regions, or show company footprint.
          Supports both point maps (lat/long) and area maps (country_code).
