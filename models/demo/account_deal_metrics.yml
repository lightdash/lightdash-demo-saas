        Demonstrates the workaround for metrics that need different levels of aggregation.
        This model pre-computes total accounts per segment in dbt, so the denominator
        for percentage calculations is always correct, even when grouped by deal-level
        dimensions like plan.

        pct_accounts_with_won_deals:

          description: >
            Percentage of accounts in a segment that have Won deals.
            The denominator (total_accounts_in_segment) is pre-computed in dbt
            and is NOT affected by the plan dimension.
