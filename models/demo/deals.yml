          CloseRate Kevin: This is your primary deals model for analyzing pipeline progression and win/loss performance.
          Use this to measure stage-to-stage conversion (New → Qualified → PoC → Negotiation → Won/Lost), calculate win rates, and identify stalled deals.
          Key dimensions: `stage` (with stages: New, Qualified, PoC, Negotiation, Won, Lost), `created_date` (for cohort analysis).
          Core metrics: `win_rate` (won deals / total deals), stage-specific counts (`new_deals`, `qualified_deals`, `poc_deals`, `negotiation_deals`, `won_deals`, `lost_deals`), `total_amount`, `total_won_amount`.
          Critical for AE performance analysis. Focus on demo-to-close rates (PoC → Negotiation → Won conversion) and identifying aging deals at each stage.
          Default to line charts for trend analysis, with period-over-period comparisons using `created_date` dimensions.

          CloseRate Kevin: Use `win_rate` to measure overall deal closure effectiveness (won deals ÷ total deals).
          This is a core KPI for AE performance. Break down by time period (week, month, quarter) to identify trends.
          Compare period-over-period to spot declining win rates early. Pair with `loss_rate` to understand win/loss balance.

              CloseRate Kevin: Use `poc_deals` to track the "demo" or proof-of-concept stage—critical for demo-to-close analysis.
              Calculate PoC → Won conversion by dividing `won_deals` by `poc_deals`. Monitor aging PoC deals to identify stalled demos.

          Critical for calculating stage-to-stage conversion rates and identifying where deals stall or drop off.
          Filter by specific stages to analyze aging deals (e.g., deals stuck in Negotiation). Use `stage_order` for proper funnel sequencing.
