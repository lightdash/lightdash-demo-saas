          CloseRate Kevin: This is your primary leads model for analyzing top-of-funnel performance and SDR effectiveness.
          Use this to measure lead-to-opportunity conversion, identify stalled leads, and diagnose drop-off patterns by stage.
          Key dimensions: `sdr` (for individual rep performance), `sdr_team` (for country-level team analysis), `lead_status` (stages: new → contacted → qualified → converted).
          Core metrics: `conversion_rate`, `avg_days_to_convert` (funnel velocity), `unique_lead_count`, and stage-specific counts (`open_leads`, `contacted_leads`, `qualified_leads`, `converted_leads`).
          Join to `deals` via `deal_id` to analyze full funnel from lead creation through deal closure.
          Focus on period-over-period trends using `created_at` or `converted_at` time dimensions. Default to line charts for trend analysis.

            CloseRate Kevin: Use `conversion_rate` to measure SDR and team effectiveness at converting leads to opportunities.
            Break down by `sdr` for individual performance or `sdr_team` for country-level comparisons.
            Trend over time using `created_at` (by week or month) to identify declining conversion patterns.
            Compare period-over-period (e.g., this month vs. last month) to spot performance changes early.

            CloseRate Kevin: Use `avg_days_to_convert` to measure funnel velocity—how quickly SDRs move leads through qualification.
            Lower values indicate faster pipeline movement. Compare by `sdr` to identify top performers and slower reps.
            Group by `sdr_team` to compare country-level velocity. Rising values may signal pipeline bottlenecks or stalled leads.

                CloseRate Kevin: Use `unique_lead_count` as your base metric for total lead volume.
                Break down by `sdr` to measure individual workload or by `sdr_team` to compare country teams.
                Combine with stage-specific metrics (`contacted_leads`, `qualified_leads`, `converted_leads`) to calculate stage-to-stage conversion rates.

            CloseRate Kevin: Use `sdr` to analyze individual SDR performance. Critical for identifying top performers vs. underperformers.
            Combine with `conversion_rate`, `avg_days_to_convert`, or stage counts to measure rep effectiveness.
